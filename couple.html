						<h1>The Couple</h1>
						<span>Our Story</span>
					</div>

					<p>We jokingly tell friends that our relationship chemistry ended up getting better due to physics. That in essence of how we fell into love with each other. Teesha and I knew each other long before our classes though. Reetik, her brother, is close friend of mine and he is the one that unknowingly sparked the initial reaction between us. Being an Electrical engineering major, I can say that I did well in technical courses like physics in my college days. On the other hand Teesha was Biology as well as Psychology major, and therefore she was not all too familiar with such courses. Reetik asked me to teach her Physics in summer of 2012 and that is where we ended up learning the chemistry between us. The journey from then has been wonderful with some ups and downs. We have learned so much from each other (aside from physics and chemistry). She is very goal oriented while I am somewhat laid back, so it keeps us both in check to take medium pace approach in life. Teesha loves to plan surprises, so to pop the big question to her while still surprising her was quite a task. It took me five tries and a prescription bottle to finally go through a successful proposal. Now, we are taking another big step in our life to get married and we are glad that you will be there to celebrate and give us blessings.</p>
